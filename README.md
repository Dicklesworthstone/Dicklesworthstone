## The Agentic Coding Flywheel

A self-reinforcing ecosystem of 14 tools for multi-agent software development. Agents coordinate via mail, track work via beads, search past sessions, guard against destructive mistakes, and orchestrate across tmux panes. Each tool amplifies the others. The whole thing started in October 2025 and the shipping cadence accelerates with every addition.

## The Nvidia Short Thesis

In January 2025, I published a [12,000-word analysis](https://www.jeffreyemanuel.com/writing/the_short_case_for_nvda) arguing that DeepSeek and the economics of AI inference would collide with Nvidia's valuation narrative. Within days, roughly $600 billion in market cap evaporated.

> "Come for the trade, stay for the dazzling 60-minute education on the state of AI."
> — **Naval Ravikant**, founder of AngelList

> "A candidate for the most impactful short research report ever written."
> — **Matt Levine**, Bloomberg Opinion

> "Long, excellent... Jeffrey has a rare combination of experience in both computer science and investment analysis."
> — **Simon Willison**, creator of Datasette

Featured on Slashdot, Hacker News front page, and the Bankless podcast. Picked up by analysts and fund managers worldwide.
